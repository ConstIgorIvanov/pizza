### About

PizzaShop.
Getting data from mock API.
On the main screen, a list of pizzas that can be filtered /sorted by the suggested categories, as well as added to the cart.
Also, pizzas will be sorted during the search.
You can add/decrease the number of pizza in the basket.

### Using

* ReduxToolKit
* TypeScript
* react-router-dom
* scss
* react-paginate
* react-content-loader

### Note

mockAPI did not allow me to do sorting while typing in input, so sorting takes place of the  pizzas that have already arrived.

On the main page, the layout is adaptive, but at the moment I have not made an adaptive in cart.
